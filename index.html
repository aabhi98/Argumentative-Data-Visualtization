                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>The debate between which mobile operating system is better, Apple's iOS or Google's Android, has been ongoing for years. 
                    Both have their unique features and loyal fan bases, making it difficult to declare a clear winner. 
                    To delve deeper into this topic, I have chosen to analyze a dataset available on Kaggle that compares the two operating 
                    systems. The link to dataset Apple vs Android is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alanjo/android-vs-ios-devices-crossplatform-benchmarks. The dataset includes information about various aspects of the devices, such as CPU, GPU, Memory usage, UX and Total score.
                    I have used Python and the Pandas library to process and analyze the data, with a focus on comparing the performance 
                    of the two operating systems based on the given attributes. The data provides valuable insights into the strengths 
                    and weaknesses of each operating system, which can aid in the decision-making process for consumers looking to purchase a
                    new device. Throughout this analysis, I have created visualizations to present the results and make them easily 
                    understandable.</p>
                <h5>Left Chart</h5>
                <p>The chart shown above is a grouped bar chart that compares the Total Scores of Apple and Android devices. 
                    The chart is divided into two categories, Apple and Android, and their respective devices are shown on the x-axis. 
                    The Total Scores of each device are plotted on the y-axis. The chart indicates that Apple products are better than 
                    Android products, as the Total Scores of all Apple products are higher than those of Android products. The chart also 
                    shows that the iPhone XS Max has the highest Total Score among all devices, followed by the iPad Pro 12.9, and the 
                    iPhone 11 Pro Max. On the other hand, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ has the highest Total Score among all Android devices. 
                    The chart also indicates that the Total Scores of the Apple products are more consistent than those of Android products. 
                    Overall, the chart seems to be biased towards Apple products.</p>
                <h5>Right Chart</h5>
                <p>The chart on the right is a bubble chart comparing the CPU score, UX score, and memory of Apple and Android devices. 
                    The chart shows that Android devices have higher UX scores compared to Apple devices, but Apple devices have a higher 
                    CPU score and memory. The size of each bubble corresponds to the memory of the device, with larger bubbles indicating 
                    higher memory. The chart also includes a tooltip that shows the details of each device when hovered over. Overall, the 
                    chart provides a comprehensive comparison of the performance of Apple and Android devices in terms of CPU, UX, and memory.
                    This chart showcases that android devices have much better User experience when compared to Apple products that contradicts
                    proposition that Apple products are better against Android.</p>
                <h5>Rhetorical techniques/framing effects</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Color: The use of color like grey and green that each represents Apple and Android products was used to distinguish
                        the products in the graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anchoring: I have used bubble chart to represent that android products have better aspects in some of the of features
                        compared to apple products
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have added respective Apple and Android backgrounds for the winner in a given chart
                    </li>
                </ol>
